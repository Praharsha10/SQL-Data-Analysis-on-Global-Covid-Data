This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover key trends and insights. The analysis includes examining case counts, mortality rates, recovery rates, and vaccination progress across different regions and time periods. SQL queries are used to aggregate and filter the data, identify patterns, and visualize critical statistics to understand the impact of COVID-19 worldwide. This project serves as a foundation for data-driven decision-making and highlights SQLâ€™s power in handling large-scale, real-world datasets.
